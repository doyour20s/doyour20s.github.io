<h1>Do.Your.Twenties!</h1>
</header>

<h2>The Game</h2>
<p><strong>Do.your.Twenties</strong> is a popular lifetime game enhancing your friends' fitness as well as providing decent entertainment in a lot of situations.</p> 

<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>Once entered <strong>Do.your.Twenties</strong> you are part of <strong>Do.your.Twenties</strong> <u>for your life</u>. So don't enter the <strong>Do.your.Twenties!</strong></p> 


<h2>The Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>You may Call any other <strong>Do.your.Twenties-player</strong> with "Do your Twenties" and they have to do twenty push-ups on the spot.</li>
<li>A Call may only occur every 60 minutes. All players who witnessed this Call (including the Caller and the Called) may not be Called to do push-ups within the next 60 minutes.</li> 
<li>If anyone calls "Do your Twenties" on someone who witnessed a Call (including the Caller and the Called) within the last 60 minutes they have to do twenty push-ups themselves.</li>
<li>The 60 minutes time always starts from the last performed push-ups.</li>
<li>If the Caller and the Called are not exactly sure whether 60 minutes have already passed, both should do ten push-ups.</li>
<li>A delay of the push-ups may be agreed between the Called and the Caller.</li>
<li>The exact wording of "Do your Twenties" is not necessary, similar enough phrases like "have you done your Twenties already" should also be accepted.</li>
<li>Any question regarding the rules should be decided between the players.</li>
<li>You enter the Do.your.Twenties-game by doing your first Call on someone who is already in the game.</li> 
<li>Calling people that are not part of Do.your.Twenties does not have any consequences.</li>
<li>Thou shalt not leave the game.<sup>*</sup></li>
</ol>

<h6>* But of course there are circumstances where you'd rather have a life than do push-ups. In that case you can deny a Call and exit the game. After a long period of missing out on Do.your.Twenties, Re-entering the game is possible.</h6>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Alice meets Bob at 13:00h and calls "Do your Twenties". Bob does twenty push-ups. 30 minutes later (13:30h) Bob meets Cloe. Cloe calls "Do your Twenties" on Bob. Poor her, she has to do the push-ups herself.
Bob meets Alice again at 14:15h. Alice tries to call Bob, but the last push-ups he witnessed were at 13:30h so Alice also has to do twenty push-ups. Fitness and bliss for everyone.</p>

<h2>Spirit of the Game</h2>
<p>The spirit in which <strong>Do.your.Twenties</strong> should be played is to provide entertainment and fitness for everyone, as well as a long-term feeling of fairness. Every question regarding the rules should be resolved with this in mind.</p>
<p>It is considered polite to not start your conversation immediately with the Call. As such it also impolite to interrupt a Call happening on you which is nicely packaged within the conversation.</p>

<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>Exercises other than push-ups can be agreed on amongst your fellow players.</p>
